# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
V. Isualize, CEO of a new ridesharing app called PyBer, has tasked the data analytics team with analyzing data ranging from January, 2019 through early May, 2019.   Utilizing the same data set the CEO has informed the team of a second request, this time analyzing the difference in fares between the different city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) for the same timeframe. 

## Analysis Results
### Ridesharing Data by City Type

Picture

As you can see in the data above, Urban areas show to have the highest number of "Total Rides", almost 2000 more "Total Drivers" than Suburban and Rural areas and the lowest "Avg Fare per Ride".  The "Average Fare per Driver" is also much lower than Suburban and Rural areas.

### Sum of Total Fares Each Week

Picture

As shown above, Urban areas consistently show higher total fare amounts when compared to Suburban and Rural areas. These numbers tend to make sense given the differences noted before in Total Rides and Total Drivers.

### Total Fares by City Type

The graph shown above makes it much easier to see the overall Total Fares by City Type and how those fare totals trend by month for each respective city type. The Y-axis represents Total Fares ($USD) while the X-axis represents each month data was analyzed. Different colors were used to make it easier to decipher how each city type performed.

## Summary
In summary, it is very clear that the most revenue is generated in Urban areas. It should be noted however that all three city types see an increase in revenues just before March. This could be due to numerous circumstances, such as improved weather and people spending more time outdoors traveling.  Suburban areas specifically see an upwards trend in revenues moving into May, suggesting that people may make their way into more Urban areas for different entertainment events, social events, restaurants etc. It would be in the interest of PyBer to do more analysis on the increase of revenues for Suburban areas during the month of April, as Urban areas show a decrease during the same period.

There are many factors that could play into why each city type performs differently. For example, one reason rural revenues are so low could be the cost to travel into Urban areas via the PyBer app. Another factor to consider would be fuel costs for the drivers in the different areas.  It would be beneficial to CEO V.Isualize to have a much broader data set to analyze in order to paint a more accurate picture.  This would only benefit V.
